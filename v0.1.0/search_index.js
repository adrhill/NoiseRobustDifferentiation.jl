A stopping   condition based on the norm of the gradient vector g   below would be an easy modification.  No default value.\nα::Real:       Regularization parameter.  This is the main parameter   to fiddle with.  Start by varying by orders of   magnitude until reasonable results are obtained.  A   value to the nearest power of 10 is usally adequate.   No default value.  Higher values increase   regularization strenght and improve conditioning.\n\nKeywords\n\nu_0::Array{<:Real,1}:             Initialization of the iteration.  Default value is the   naive derivative (without scaling), of appropriate   length (this being different for the two methods).   Although the solution is theoretically independent of   the intialization, a poor choice can exacerbate   conditioning issues when the linear system is solved.\nscale::String:   Scale of dataset, \"large\" or \"small\" (case insensitive).     Default is \"small\" .  \"small\"  has somewhat better    boundary behavior, but becomes unwieldly for very large datasets.     \"large\" has simpler numerics but   is more efficient for large-scale problems.  \"large\" is   more readily modified for higher-order derivatives,   since the implicit differentiation matrix is square.\nε::Real:       Parameter for avoiding division by zero.  Default value   is 1e-6.  Results should not be very sensitive to the   value.  Larger values improve conditioning and   therefore speed, while smaller values give more   accurate results with sharper jumps.\ndx::Real:      Grid spacing, used in the definition of the derivative   operators.  Default is 1 / length(data).\nprecond::String:     Select the preconditioner for the conjugate gradient method.   Default is 'none'.\nscale = \"small\":   While in principle precond=\"simple\" should speed things up,    sometimes the preconditioner can cause convergence problems instead,   and should be left to \"none\".\nscale = \"large\":   The improved preconditioners are one of the main features of the    algorithm, therefore using the default \"none\" is discouraged.   Currently, \"diagonal\",\"amg_rs\",\"amg_sa\", \"cholesky\"   are available.\ndiff_kernel::String:   Kernel to use in the integral to smooth the derivative. By default it's \"abs\",    the absolute value u. However, it can be changed to \"square\",   the square value (u)^2. The latter produces smoother   derivatives, whereas the absolute values tends to make them more blocky.\ncg_tol::Real:         Tolerance used in conjugate gradient method. Default is 1e-6.\ncgmaxit::Int:   Maximum number of iterations to use in conjugate gradient optimisation.    Default is 100.\nshow_diagn::Bool:       Flag whether to display diagnostics at each iteration. Default is false.     Useful for diagnosing preconditioning problems. When tolerance is not met,   an early iterate being best is more worrying than a large relative residual.\n\nOutput\n\nu:             Estimate of the regularized derivative of data with    length(u) = length(data).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#Differences-to-MATLAB-Code","page":"Home","title":"Differences to MATLAB Code","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#Conjugate-gradient-method","page":"Home","title":"Conjugate gradient method","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The original code uses MATLAB's inbuilt function pcg(), which implements the preconditioned conjugate gradients method (PCG).
