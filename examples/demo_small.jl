Data was generated in Matlab using
    noisyabsdata = absdata + 0.05 * randn( size( absdata ) ); 
results vary slightly with different random instances

Defaults mean that 
    u = TVDiff(df.noisyabsdata, 500, 0.2 ); 
would be the same.
Best result obtained after 7000 iterations, though difference is minimal.
Set last input to `false` to turn off diagnostics.
